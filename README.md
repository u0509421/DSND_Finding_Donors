This repo is the supervised learning project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms including Decision Tree, SVM to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then I choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data through GridSearch
